# Daily Planner

A simple but effective daily planner that allows the user to plan their day over a 12 hour period starting at 7:00 am and finishing at 7:00pm
Each hourly timeslot can be allocated any activity for that day.
When the user hits the save button if they shut down the daily planner app it will save and retrieve the data entered from local storage.
The planner automatically highlights the current hour timeslot by a distinctive pink image background, subsequently past timeslots are in black and future timeslots have a nice image of a autumn tree

#Future Developments
Expanding the daily planner to be a weekly planner that has an input form that the user can specify the length of the appointment time either 30 minutes or 60 minutes and whether it will be a recurring event over the week.
Allowing appointed timeslots to be downloaded by guests invited to the meeting.
